## Testing
We follow a **unit testing** approach, and **tests are written alongside each component** to ensure their functionality and integrity. When adding new components or making changes to existing ones, please include corresponding unit tests.

## Project Structure

This project follows **Atomic Design** principles to organize components. The structure is modular and organized into five levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, labels, etc.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms that form more complex elements (e.g., a form group, a card).
3. **Organisms**: Larger, reusable components (e.g., a navigation bar, a user profile).
4. **Templates**: Page-level components that define the layout and structure.
5. **Pages**: Specific pages that use templates and organize the content for the app.

The project is built using **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
