**Tagline**: Instant verification, infinite traceability.

QualiNova is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize quality certification management. By leveraging Stellar blockchain technology, QualiNova enables certifying companies to issue, register, and verify digital certifications securely and transparently.

- **Real-Time Verification**: Stakeholders (companies, auditors, customers) can instantly verify the validity of certifications using a certification number or QR code.
- **Immutability and Security**: All certifications are stored immutably on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring data integrity and eliminating the risk of forgery.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate with existing quality management and audit systems, streamlining adoption and operational efficiency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend for certifying companies to manage certifications and a robust backend for data processing and blockchain integration.
